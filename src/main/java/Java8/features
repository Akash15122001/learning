*Functional programming
    -focus on functions more than objects.

*Lambda expression
    -removes more of the boiler plate code.
    -no file of an inner class.
    -used in functional interface

*Stream API
    achieve concurrency
    helps in debugging,collections,db connections.
    -once used cannot be reused.
    -Intermediate method and Terminate  method.

*Define methods in interface
    -Interface(1.0 to 1.7)
        +At first, we were able to only declare methods in it.
        +By default they r public  abstract.
        +Static methods were not allowed.
    -Interface(1.8)
        +Should use default keyword.
        +Cant override object class methods.
        +Define static method.

*Foreach method
    -Internal part of Collections.
    -Internal loops.
    -Internal iterations.
    -Uses Arrays.stream() and lambda expression.
    -Implement consumer interface.

*DateTime
    -java.time.LocalDate

*Method Reference
    -Call by Method
    -Passsing function to a function
